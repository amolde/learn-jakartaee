Learn Jakarta EE APIs
=====================

## Enterprise Java Bean

This project is a utility project that is used by the JSF and Struts applications.

This project implements a `PeopleService` that manages a collection of people. The
implementation is somewhat cheesy in that the collection is kept in memory and not
an actual database.

## TODO

Change the implementation to JPA as shown in the JPA project.
